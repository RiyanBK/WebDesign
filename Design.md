# Rendez-View Web App

## Overview
**Rendez-View** is a scheduling web app where people upload their schedules and add their friends while an AI determines the next appropriate meeting time. The AI will also suggest activities or places to eat nearby. Users can view their friends' schedules to manually select a time if desired. The objective is to make interpersonal and group scheduling easier.

### 1. Project Choice

#### A. Functionality

##### Core Features
- **Calendar Upload:** Users can import/link their Google or Outlook calendar to Rendez-View, or manually add events.
- **Different Tabs:** Multiple tabs at the bottom (mobile) or side (web) of the screen for quick navigation (Home, Calendar, Search, Messages, Profile).

##### Page Details
- **Home Page:** A scrollable list of planned events and a mini calendar view.
- **Calendar Page:** Fully functional calendar. Users can create events, and AI will find suitable times across all users' schedules. Users can indicate if events are high or low importance so they could perhaps be moved in favor of higher priority events.

- **Messages Page:** Allows users to message each other after connecting for easier scheduling.
- **Profile Page:** Users create a profile with necessary details (for recommendations and connections) and upload their calendar. On account creation, there is a screen where users can indicate preferences (likes, dislikes, lifestyle) that the AI can then use to suggest times and places to hang out.

##### User Flow
- **Home Page:** Main landing page where users can browse and navigate.
- **Calendar Page:** Displays the user's calendar with a "Create an event" button for quick scheduling.
- **Transition:** Users move between pages using icons at the bottom or side of the screen.
- **Friending:** Users can search for and add friends on the Search page.

Logo is distinct from Apple Calendar with the Rendez-view name instead of Calendar so it's distinguishable.
